## Hello World! Welcome to the 2025 master guide of becoming a TECHNICAL FOUNDER. 

This README page provides a concise overview of the essential knowledge I believe aspiring technical founders should master for success in 2025 and beyond. I've integrated my personal notes directly into the relevant modules. An ideal technical entrepreneur is capable of growing the company financially and operationally. Cutting-edge software and hardware knowledges help founders make better products and find its market fits. While financial knowledges help company make better decisions on mergers and acquisitions in order to either vertically or horizontally integrate resources. Understanding the capital markets also help founders make better financing and capital allocation decisions. 

**1) Finance**
**2) Software**
**3) Hardware**

The course is structured to maximize your learning efficiency by curating the most impactful content. Here on this README page, I’ll break down these three key areas, offering a clear roadmap of the material so you can plan your study schedule. Each lesson links directly to its corresponding section for easy navigation. This course is designed for learners at any level, and I consider the topics it covers to be foundational for today’s technical founders. 

A quick note: While this README is brief—intentionally providing a simple, digestible snapshot of the modules—mastering the basics of each topic takes weeks of effort, and achieving proficiency in some areas could take months to years. If you were to pursue these subjects as college courses, I estimate it would take at least five years in a tranditional classroom setting to complete them all. Certain tools can help accelerate this timeline, but even after finishing, you’ll only have a foundational grasp of each field. That said, I believe this training equips you with the broad knowledge needed to launch a career in tech entrepreneurship. It touches on a little bit of everything to get you started.

To build on this foundation, I recommend seeking out hands-on projects—especially in hardware, like manufacturing. Many colleges offer project teams and facilities that provide invaluable practical experience; take full advantage of these opportunities. As you advance in your tech startup journey, you’ll naturally deepen your expertise in specific areas, depending on your chosen product and industry.

Before you start, it is crtiical to understand that the notes are on my own.
