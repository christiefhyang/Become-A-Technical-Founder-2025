# Infrastructure Class - Kabir Gandhi

Smaller customer dont want to take on large obligation, fee per month for computation infrastructure

Players in the field

lease type

business model

growth prospect

Fiber connectivity

Server located all over geographies

mechanical/electrical infrastructure

plumbing

Customer pays for CPU/GPU

**AirTrunk:** space and power, focus on hypercale - much more scalable - have so much cash tha they are creditworthy - not default on leases. cash on cash yield and high EBITDA margin

1. **Data center**

- Retail Co-location
- Hyperscale = big tenants, really good low-cost financing. Core + Shell development model. concrete + power shell. MEP Mechanical, electrical, big tenant has specified need: Microsoft might have specifications need this cooling system

rock density = how much power can you put into a given server

Access to highly reliable power - competitive advantage

Blackstone/KKR/Digital Bridge

Digital Realty

Commercial real estate to commercial infrastructure

1. Energy Infrastruture/Natural Gas, Battery Infrastructure
2. Power & Utilities
3. Transmission, power generation
4. Digital Infra - Data center, fibers, towers, waste water treatment
5. transportation infra: toll roads, airports, FBO, PE aviation

**Model Main Difference:**

1. Payments that are defined to a schedule/fixed DSCR (covenant) - account for difference in cash flow difference - principle payments adjustable (example, DSCR is 2, FCF is 100, max debt is 50) high DSCR covenant means more conversative. Infrastructure has higher spreads with treasury than real estate. Cap rate arbitrage without necessarily have that much risk. 
2. Tax Credits
3. Not really different than regular LBO - Greenfield is unique to infrastructure

You donâ€™t really usually lever up infrastructure - countercyclical - mission critical. real estate has crazy cycles

**BIP:** buy 1 large business platform that has large infra assets. Red stop, 2 data centers, QTS. keep pumping into them for new projects and new EBITDA. $7-$10BB. Gonna IPO at some points. 

**Ares:** more credit

**Apollo:** EV of 400-800 or 1B

**KKR:** single asset transaction - no platform - they dont believe in platform premium 

**GIP:** more on big infra - more similar to Blackstone - Panama Canal

**BIWS Models - Project Finance & Infrastructure**

1. Toll Roads
2. Solar Development
3. Natural Gas
4. Offshore Wind Development
5. Debt Sizing, Sculpting
6. Quarterly Solar Plant Development
7. Airport Acquisition
